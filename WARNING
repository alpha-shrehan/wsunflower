Never declare arrays in class variables if they are not a constant
for example, 

class List
    a = [] <----------------- WRONG
    ...

This should be avoided at all costs.
The walkaround for this is to declare them in the __main__ method.

class List
    a = None

    def __main__(self)
        self.a = [] <----------------- CORRECT
